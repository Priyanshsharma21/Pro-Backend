2 Step Communication works

Scanario - Let's you have a website, now you gave a social login to user, when user clicks on this link - 

1. Redirect to OAuth Provider(FB, Google, Github) 
2. Now there they will ask user about informations like email and password.
3. If the user information is correct(means user exist in there database) then OAuth provider will generate JWT token and send it back to you(client).
4. We can decode this token (By making API request to provider - OAuth provider verify the token) and get all the information about the user like there name, email, profile pic etc.



We will use Passport Js - An Authentication Middleware
