WASM stands for WebAssembly. It's a low-level bytecode format that's designed to be executed efficiently by web browsers. It's not a programming language in itself, but rather a binary format that can be generated by a number of different programming languages, including C/C++, Rust, and AssemblyScript.

WASM was designed to address the limitations of JavaScript as a runtime for complex web applications. Unlike JavaScript, which is an interpreted language, WASM is a compiled language that can be executed more quickly and with better performance. It also allows developers to write web applications in a wider variety of languages, since any language that can compile to WASM can be used to develop web applications.

One of the key benefits of WASM is its ability to run in a sandboxed environment, which makes it more secure than running native code in the browser. It's also designed to be platform-independent, so that code written for one platform can be executed on any other platform that supports WebAssembly.

Overall, WASM is an exciting technology that's opening up new possibilities for web developers, enabling them to build more powerful and performant web applications using a wider range of programming languages.



Video and audio codecs: WebAssembly is ideal for implementing video and audio codecs because of its fast execution speed. For example, the H.264 video codec has been implemented in WebAssembly, enabling it to be run in the browser without the need for plugins.

Games: WebAssembly is also well-suited for developing browser-based games that require fast, responsive graphics and audio. Games like Doom and Quake have been ported to the browser using WebAssembly.

Cryptography: WebAssembly can be used to implement cryptographic algorithms in the browser, allowing for secure communication between users. For example, the popular cryptography library OpenSSL has been ported to WebAssembly.

Machine learning: WebAssembly can also be used for running machine learning models in the browser, allowing for real-time analysis of data without the need for a server-side backend. The TensorFlow.js library has been ported to WebAssembly to enable machine learning in the browser.
