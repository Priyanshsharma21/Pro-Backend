In Mongoose, a schema is a blueprint for defining the structure and validation rules for a MongoDB collection. A schema defines the fields, data types, and constraints for the documents in a collection. It helps to enforce data consistency and integrity by defining the rules for how the data should be stored.

A model in Mongoose is a constructor function that provides an interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents in a collection based on the schema. It represents a specific collection in MongoDB and allows developers to interact with the collection using predefined methods and queries.

A collection in MongoDB is a group of related documents that are stored together in a database. It is analogous to a table in a relational database.

A document in MongoDB is a record that is stored in a collection. It is analogous to a row in a table in a relational database. A document can have multiple fields, each with its own value, and can contain nested documents and arrays.
