Internet ->
In this world there are millions of computing devices and they are sharinf data from onw to others.
All the devices are conntect to each otuer inside network.

Small Area -> LAN
multiple LAN -> MAN

And Multiple MAN which connects whold world -> 

And collection of this WAN is internet

Internet allow user to communicate, share data, resources from anywhere in this world.
It is based on set of protocols like (OSI and TCP).

Internet Service Provider (ISP), which provides a connection to the network. Users can access resources on the internet through web browsers, email clients, messaging apps, and other software applications.














IP Suit of TCP suit -> So in order to send information from one device to other, there are set of protocols need to be follow, which are divided into layers.

Application, transport, network, data link, physical.


1. Physical layer -> Hardware layer, used to send data bits from sender to reciver. last and first layer.
connector, cables, hum, bridge, topologyu, mux demux are its part.


2. Data link layer-> 
second layer.
Take packets and convert it to bits.
1. Hop to Hop delivery.
2. flow control -> send data accordinf to reciver window size.
3. Access control -> avoide collision of messages.
4. error control - crc, checksum.
5. MAC address -> unique address to find user device.


3. Network layer-> Take data and convert it into packets.(unit of information to transfer frmo S->R each packet has header and payload, data divide into managable chunks - packets === efficient transmission of data)
1. Routung,
2. Source to dest delivery.
3. Fregmentation.

4. Transport layer -> Port to port delivery. (one app to other) -convert stream of byts into segments
1. When user access browser an port is given to it by OS, fomr that oprt to reciver the responsiblity is o transport layer.

2. Fregmentation.

3. Error control.

4. Congestion control.

5. Protocol - TCP(if need relibality - FTP), UDP (if need speed - DNS)



5. Application layer -> Manage app. have different port provide services and protocols that applications use to communicate over the internet. Provide interface too, encrypton ->
Echo -> 7
FTP - 20/21
SMTP - 25
DNS - 53
HTTP - 80
HTTPS- 443












IP Address- > Use to find the device location inside the network

IP -> String of numbers seprated with . -> consist of two parts (network address & host address

2 versions -> IPV4 -> 32bit, IPV6-> 128bit)

When user wants to send data to different network or same network then they can use ARP(app resolu proto)

Contain -our IP, our Mac, dest IP, broadcast (fffff) -> all recive,  reciver see ip is of me, comm stablish
