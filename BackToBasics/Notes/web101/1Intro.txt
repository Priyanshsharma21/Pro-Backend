Before JavaScript, web pages were largely static and limited in their interactivity. (Text + Images and show on web page)
Limited options for adding interactivity to web pages, such as using HTML forms or client-side scripting languages like VBScript, but Limited capablities and not supported bya ll web browsers.
In general, the web was a less dynamic and interactive place before the introduction of JavaScript. User interactions were limited, and web pages were not able to respond in real-time to user actions.

With the introduction of JavaScript, web developers were able to add interactivity to their web pages and create more engaging and dynamic user experiences. This helped to pave the way for the modern web, which is now filled with dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications.



JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in May 1995.
At the time, Eich was working for Netscape Communications Corporation and was tasked with creating a scripting language that would be embedded in the Netscape Navigator web browser.

The original goal of JavaScript was to provide a lightweight language that would allow web developers to add dynamic content and interactivity to their web pages. Before JavaScript, web pages were static and could only display text and images. JavaScript allowed web developers to create more dynamic and interactive web pages by enabling them to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and respond to user actions.

Eich's original design for JavaScript was heavily influenced by other programming languages, including C, Java, and Scheme. He wanted to create a language that was easy to learn and use, while also being powerful and flexible.



Over the years, JavaScript has evolved and grown in popularity, and is now used not only for web development, but also for server-side development, desktop application development, and even mobile app development.
